COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project
Overview
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using Python, focusing on techniques applicable to global health data tracking. This project uses the Iris dataset as a prototype to showcase data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization methods that can be adapted for COVID-19 datasets. A Jupyter notebook contains the core analysis, and a custom website presents the results interactively, hosted on GitHub Pages.
Objectives
Load and explore a dataset using pandas to understand its structure.

Perform basic statistical analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.

Create visualizations using matplotlib to communicate insights effectively.

Develop a website to showcase the analysis in an accessible, user-friendly format.

Demonstrate transferable skills for analyzing real-world datasets, such as COVID-19 case data.

Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language for data analysis.

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.

seaborn: Enhanced visualization styling.

scikit-learn: Source of the Iris dataset.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Website development for presenting results.

GitHub Pages: Hosting the project website.

How to Run/View
Jupyter Notebook
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the Notebook:
Open iris_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

View on GitHub:
Access the notebook directly: iris_analysis.ipynb.

Website
Live Website: Visit the project website hosted on GitHub Pages: https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/.

Features: Explore interactive visualizations, project details, tools, and insights in a user-friendly interface.

Navigation: Use the menu to jump between sections (Home, Visualizations, Tools & Setup, Insights, About).

Visualizations
The notebook and website include four visualizations:
Line Chart: Mean feature values across Iris species, showing trends.

Bar Chart: Average petal length by species, comparing differences.

Histogram: Distribution of sepal length, highlighting data spread.

Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs. petal length, revealing species clusters.

Insights
Species Separation: Setosa is distinctly separable due to its smaller petal measurements, making it ideal for classification tasks.

Feature Differences: Virginica has the largest sepal and petal measurements, followed by versicolor, with clear distinctions in the bar and scatter plots.

Visualization Clarity: The scatter plot effectively highlights species clusters, indicating strong correlations between sepal and petal length.

Transferability: The data processing and visualization techniques (e.g., grouping, plotting) are directly applicable to COVID-19 data, such as tracking cases or deaths by country over time.

Reflections
Technical Skills: Gained proficiency in pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for creating clear, informative visualizations.

Visualization Importance: Learned that well-labeled plots with distinct colors and legends enhance communication of insights.

Web Development: Developed a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages, to make the project accessible to a broader audience.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling (e.g., try-except for file loading) to ensure reliability.

Future Work: Plan to extend the project by integrating real COVID-19 data from sources like Our World in Data or Johns Hopkins, applying similar analysis to track global case trends or vaccination rates.

Notes
Dataset Choice: The Iris dataset was used for its simplicity and availability, serving as a prototype to demonstrate analysis techniques. The methods are adaptable to COVID-19 datasets (e.g., case counts, deaths, vaccinations) with minor code adjustments.

Website: The website enhances the project by presenting visualizations and insights interactively, making it easy for evaluators to explore the work without running the notebook.

GitHub Repository: The repository contains all necessary files, including the notebook (iris_analysis.ipynb), website files (website/), and this README: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.
